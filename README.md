# DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20tree-%F0%9F%8C%B3-lightgreen)](https://offset.earth/philsturgeon)

As developers we all want to protect our code from dicks that try to steal, sell, infringe or just generally rip us off. For this we have licenses like GPL, MIT, etc.

Sometimes however, you release a project where you just don't care what happens to the code. For this Sam Hocevar created the [WTFPL] which is a brilliant license.

For those of you who want something in between, try the [DBAD license].

###Goals of the DBAD License as envisioned in this fork of the Development of This License by SPEKTRUM-Creations 

For those of you who want a legitimate DBAD license that is what this fork is intended to be: an all out legal and binding contract that protects the original developer during development and beyond regardless of that developer sharing and encouraging collaboration of such a project and it's code. The DBAD License is meant to protect primarily the developer throughout the early stages of development for my idea to stable prototype all the way up to stable release and beyond. Should a project stagnate for a given amount of time or if it's stifles innovation then the DBAD License is intended to call bullshit on the developer and called a developer or a dick for sitting on code that could be used to further humanity however that said if a developer has taken continual steps over a long period of time and it appears to some that it has stagnated while it has not it has only continue to grow slowly then the developer is no longer a dick end it is upon those who intend to move the project forward to contact the original developer and partner with or support through some sort of collaboration that open source project while making it clear that contributions are beingOffered for the benefit of both parties or multiple parties as it were.  The idea of Share and share alike as well as copyright disclosure and retainment for use in free open source software Is in my estimation necessary but the original author or idea holder should not ever give up rights to the idea unless it is deemed unavailable, or honorable to forfeit search rights to further humanity our society as a whole in such a case it should be noted that this becomes public domain and nobody made profit on it anymore than any other person or company as it were, such as in the case of W3C properties for instance HTML or XML cannot necessarily be copyrighted by one individual or one person having an idea regarding the entire scope of such language compositions in the same way that Webster does not own the words in the dictionary but can profit on a book compiling those words in the same way that Other dictionaries can come along and profit in the same way through a compilation of words and their definitions, their origins etc.

Please consider joining this project or the original project https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad and if you are a lawyer or know of a lawyer who can make the repositories goals possible so as to assure the legality for any and all developers wishing to employ this Sort of protection within a legally binding license please, please... your pro bono work on this project will be gratefully Accepted and greatly appreciated and It will be  honored as a civic duty and an honorable step in deterring unnecessary litigation As well as being a point of order for the preservation of law and integrity in the development community whether it be individuals or corporations.
